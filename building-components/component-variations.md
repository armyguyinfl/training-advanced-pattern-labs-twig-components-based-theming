# Component Variations

Component variations are instances of a component with minor or big changes. Component variations are a great way to create different versions of a component without having to rebuild the component from scratch.

Let's take the Card component for example.  Here are three different ways in which this component will be displayed:

![Default Card component.](../.gitbook/assets/card.png)

![Inverse Card variation](../.gitbook/assets/card-inverse.png)

![Opposite Card variation](../.gitbook/assets/card-oposite.png)
