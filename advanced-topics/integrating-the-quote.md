# Integrating the Quote

Just as we did with the Hero component, we need to build build a paragraph type for the Quote as well as integrate it with Drupal.

## New assignments

* Create a new paragraph type for the [Quote component](https://mariohernandez.gitbook.io/training/component-lifecycle/paragraph-types).
* Then [integrate the Quote](../component-lifecycle/getting-twig-variables.md) component with Drupal, similarly how we integrated the Hero.
