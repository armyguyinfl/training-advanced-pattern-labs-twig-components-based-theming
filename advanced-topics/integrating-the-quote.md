# Integrating the Quote

Just as we did with the Hero component, we need to build build a paragraph type for the Quote  as well as integrate it with Drupal.

### New assignments

* Follow [the same instructions](paragraph-types.md) for creating a paragraph type for the Hero, to create a new paragraph type for the Quote component.
* Then [integrate the Quote component with Drupal](getting-twig-variables.md), similarly how we integrated the Hero.  Keep in mind, we need to be able to create variations within Drupal.
