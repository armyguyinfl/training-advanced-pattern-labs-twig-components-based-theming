# Integrating the Quote

Just as we did with the Hero component, we need to build build a paragraph type for the Quote as well as integrate it with Drupal.

## New assignments

* Create a new paragraph type for the [Quote component](https://mariohernandez.gitbook.io/training/component-lifecycle/paragraph-types).
* Then [integrate the Quote component with Drupal](https://github.com/mariohernandez/training/tree/3b31750a83e5ccda5cfe62e460988983031df6f4/advanced-topics/getting-twig-variables.md), similarly how we integrated the Hero.
