# Mediacurrent Theme Generator

In a fast moving industry like ours, it is imperative that we have tools that allow us to build environments (front and back-end), quickly while providing consistency. The same way we have DevOps processes for quickly spinning off a complete Drupal website built with composer, drush, Drupal console and more, we need a system that automates the Drupal theme creation process in an effort to provide all the essential tools needed for a modern, best practices, and standards compliant front-end environment.

The Mediacurrent's theme generator is a scaffolding tool which has evolved with the years to provide a production-ready Drupal 8 theme that is component-based ready out of the box.

## Working with the theme generator

Although the local environment we provide for this training already includes a fully functional drupal 8 theme created with the theme generator, we are including the resources below in the event you would like to try the generator in your next project.
