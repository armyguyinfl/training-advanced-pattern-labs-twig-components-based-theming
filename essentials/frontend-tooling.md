# Front-end tooling

In a fast moving industry like ours, it is imperative that we have tools that allow us to build environments (front and back-end), quickly while providing consistency. The same way we have DevOps processes for quickly spinning off a complete Drupal website built with composer, Drush, Drupal Console and more, we need a system that automates the Drupal theme creation process in an effort to provide all the essential tools needed for a modern, best practices, and standards compliant front-end environment.

The local environment we provide for this training already includes a fully functional Drupal 8 theme, which includes the following Front-End tools:

* [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/): Design system to build a living style-guide.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): A Javascript runtime system used by most modern apps today.
* [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): Node Version Manager.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node Package Manager to manage node dependencies.
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): Task runner to automate repetitive tasks such as code compile and more.
