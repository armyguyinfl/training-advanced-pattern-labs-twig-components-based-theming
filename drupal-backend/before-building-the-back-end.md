# Before building the back-end

### Drupal entities

Typically in a component-based project, Drupal will use entities to build the components infrastructure in the back end.  Entities such as nodes, blocks, paragraph types, and even views, are some of the ways we can transition from a traditional development approach of building pages to a modular system of components.

Let's take the Hero component as an example, In Drupal we could build a custom block or a paragraph type called Hero.  This custom entity would be made of the same fields we identified when building the Hero component in Pattern Lab \(image, eyebrow, title, body, cta\).
