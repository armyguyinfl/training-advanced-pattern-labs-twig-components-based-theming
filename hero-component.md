# Hero Component

The Hero component is a more complex component because it contains more fields, logic and it also makes use oof previously built components. With the Hero we will reuse other components by using twig's [Include](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/include.html) and [Embed](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/embed.html) statements.  More on this later.
