# Integrating the Card

Our homepage is displaying blog posts that meet the requirements of the Drupal View we created, but they lack styles.  As we indicated before, each blog article will be represented by a Card component.  Let's integrate the Card so our articles inherit all the attributes of the component.Let's recap the work we've done and what the next steps are:

1. We built the Card component \(with the **Card Wide** variant\)
2. Created a Blog content type with designated View Modes \(**Full content, Featured, & Teaser**\)
3. We created a Drupal View to generate the blog listing sections in our homepage
4. Finally, we created several blog posts to populate the homepage

#### Next steps:

We'll get back to the full view of a blog post later, for now we are going to focus on associating the Card component with the Teaser view mode, and the Card Wide variant with the Featured view mode.  How do we do this?  The answer is Twig template suggestions.
