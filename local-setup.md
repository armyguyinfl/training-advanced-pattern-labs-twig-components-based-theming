# Local Setup

### Install Drupal 8

#### **Use any of the options below:**

* Use [Acquia Dev Desktop](https://docs.acquia.com/dev-desktop/install/) to setup a Drupal 8 website
* You can use [Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html), [DDev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html) to setup a new Drupal 8 Website

Regardless of which option you use to setup Drupal 8, the following modules need to be installed and enabled:

* [Components Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components)
* [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)
* [Entity Reference Revisions](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_reference_revisions)
* [Devel & Kint](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) \(both in same module\)
* [Admin toolbar](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar)
* [Twig Field Value](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_field_value)
* [Focal Point](https://www.drupal.org/project/focal_point)
* [Crop API](https://www.drupal.org/project/crop)
* Responsive Images \(core\)
* Media & Media Library \(both on core\)

You also need the latest LTS versions of [NodeJS with NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Ideally, if you can install NodeJS with [NVM](https://tecadmin.net/install-nodejs-with-nvm/) that would be preferred.
