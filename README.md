# Welcome

In this two-day hands-on training workshop we will cover the process of identifying, building, and integrating components in the context of a Drupal 8 website. We will make heavy use of Pattern Lab in combination with Horizon Front-End framework, for building and styling components. Drupal 8 best practices will be at the core of the training to ensure components are built in a way that leverage caching, performance and reusability.

We will touch on principles of Atomic Design for building flexible and scalable components, how to effectively manage media in Drupal 8 by building reusable image styles. In addition, we will learn powerful practices provided by Twig such as includes, embeds, loops, and conditional statements to add advanced logic to the components we build.

You are encouraged to ask questions and to challenge the trainer to ensure you get the most out of this training.
